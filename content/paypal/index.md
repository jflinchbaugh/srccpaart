## Easy Payment with PayPal

We try to make
paying your membership
to SRCC as easy as possible.
We're using PayPal
to accept **Credit Cards**, **Debit Cards**,
or **Venmo**.
[Contact us](mailto:contact@srcccpaart.org),
and we'll provide you with a link to pay how you want:
* **Manually:**
  Click the payment link every month
  to send your membership dues.
* **Automatically:**
  _Subscribe_
  and automatically send your dues
  on the same day every month.

## Subscriptions

Setup a subscription,
and you can automatically send your dues on the same day every month.
When you want to turn it off,
you can [contact us](mailto:contact@srccpaart.org)
_or_ login to PayPal
and cancel your subscription for yourself.

Here's the management and cancelation process you'll see in the PayPal app:
