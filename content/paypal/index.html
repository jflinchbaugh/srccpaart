<h2>Easy Payment with PayPal</h2>

<p>
  We try to make
  paying your membership
  to SRCC as easy as possible.
  We're using PayPal
  to accept <strong>Credit Cards</strong>, <strong>Debit Cards</strong>,
  or <strong>Venmo</strong>.
  <a href = "mailto:contact@srcccpaart.org">Contact Us</a>,
  and we'll provide you with a link to pay how you want:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Manually:</strong>
    Click the payment link every month
    to send your membership dues.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Automatically:</strong>
    <em>Subscribe</em>
    and automatically send your dues
    on the same day every month.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Subscriptions</h2>
<p>
  Setup a subscription,
  and you can automatically send your dues on the same day every month.
  When you want to turn it off,
  you can <a href = "mailto:contact@srccpaart.org">contact us</a>
  <em>or</em> login to PayPal
  and cancel your subscription for yourself.
