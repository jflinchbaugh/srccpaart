## Scheduling Guidelines for the Event Room and Stage

The music and event space is in demand
on weekday evenings,
so we need to make availability fair to all.

### Weekdays after 5pm

* All scheduling is done
  on the Google Calendar shared
  by all SRCC Members.
* All music members can reserve the stage
  for **1 session per week**,
  up to **14 days** in advance.
* Reservations can be up to **3 hours** maximum.
* Additional sessions can be scheduled,
  however no sooner than the day prior.
* To further maximize availability for everyone,
  we __recommend_
  scheduling within 2 timeslots each evening:
  **5pm-8pm** and **8pm-11pm**.
